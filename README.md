## ghacks-user.js

- This is a rough draft, please read the old intro currently at the start of the user.js in the meantime.
- Paragraph here about not jumping in without reading first, and backing up, and understanding the changes

### Origins
- yada yada

### Purpose
- discuss why use a js (enforcement on startup, migration)
- outline trade-offs between security vs privacy etc
- explain expectations and site breakage
- explain this version is "middle to high road" with very little breakage (but it will happen) but is only a starting point
- no one size fits all, this is a template, fork it! Customize it! (see goals, we won't set you wrong)

### Goals & Standards
To be **THE** template and resource all other user.js' come to for news, links, information and more, which means it needs to be:

- comprehensive (mention prefs are included at default for completeness/enforcement, alot are included and changed for future-proofing, etc)
- current and available and change-trackable (hey, we're on github now)
- easy to understand (good simple less-techincal descriptions)
- accountable and a resource (lots of links to authorative authors and tech papers etc)
- correct and to dispell myths and bad advise (see accountable)
- eassy to follow and report and discuss (logical numbered structuring)
- give good advise (see trade-offs)
- expanded on with more information, such as FF version numbering for introduction and deprecation of preferences
- archived for each stable release (starting with 51)

- to provide illustrated wiki topics to help
- to make it as easy as possible for anyone to use a user.js and get it right
- to provide two or three future forks with differnent settings from painless no-breakage, thru to super-hardened for use with multiple profiles

### Implementation
- expectations of the user
- link to wiki on testing and tweaking in a portable FF first
- backup first: link to wiki articles on backup & restore methods

### Troubleshooting
- wiki links

### Help & Resources
- Wiki links, appendices etc

### Acknowledgements
- yada yada
